# Road Detection with Computer-Vision

### About the project

I have worked in this project with professor Aldo Von Wangenheim and other contributors, such as PET-MA and Ampera Racing, to develop a self driving system for non-paved or low quality roads. 

This is one example of what we achieved during this project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs3ZOUOXXh0&list=PLmDIGfkfgKy2085gVEJbKbRrVP86CDD95&index=6.

### About the notebook

The code is useful for Data Augmentation, muliplying our image dataset by 10. Its important to maintain the contrast levels close to the original, avoiding any possible problems with the recognition.

Only the flipping process should be done with the labels of each image and the other ones should be simply copied, maintaining the same labels for images with different contrasts.
